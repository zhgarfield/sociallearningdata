Frequently elders, who stayed in camp when the hunt went off, called the children into the main camp and enacted a mock hunt with them there. Stretching a discarded piece of net across the camp, they pretended to be animals, showing the children how to drive them into the nets. And, of course, the children played house, learning the patterns of cooperation that would be necessary for them later in life. They also learned the prime lesson of egality, other than for purposes of division of labor making no distinction between male and female, this nuclear family or that. All in the bopi were apua'i to each other, and so they would remain throughout their lives. At every age level--childhood, youth, adulthood, or old age--everyone of that level is apua'i to all the others. Only adults sometimes (but so rarely that I think it was only done as a kind of joke, or possibly insult) made the distinction that the Bira do, using apua'i for male and amua'i for female. Male or female, for the Mbuti, if you are the same age you are apua'i , and that means that you share everything equally, regardless of kinship or gender.","Age stratification (561)

In the Mbuti scheme of things age was clearly the dominant principle of social organization, with territory hard on its heels, then gender, and kinship lagging behind. The responsibility allocated to childhood was that of ritual purification, most specifically in the daily act of lighting the hunting fire. The youths had full control of the political arena, and the adults were fully occupied with all the major economic responsibilities. The role of the elders was the one, as vital as all the others, of socialization. During the daytime, when youths and adults were off on the hunt, the elders mostly stayed behind in the camp, looking after the young children. By playing with them, acting out great sagas of the hunting and gathering days of yore, or just by lying back under the trees and telling stories, old women and men, the tata of the camp, filled the youngsters with their own love of the forest, their trust in it, and their respect for the forest values that made life so good.","Age stratification (561)

The situation is comparable between the archers and the net-hunters, and yet each of these groups practices a different hunting technique, and the process of fission and fusion takes an opposite direction. Either the archers or the net-hunters could, in fact, operate perfectly efficiently without all the internal movement that we have seen, and they may very-well once have operated as patrilineal bands. While in no way supporting those who suggest that band composition is due to local ecology, it is undeniable that there is an interest in lineage, evident in the attempt to balance lineages and prevent lineage dominance. Further, the camp plans indicate a general tendency toward lineage solidarity, particularly in times of crisis. For instance, with reference to Plans 9 and 10, the normally unsystematic camp plan that pertained (9) was abruptly altered and became divided along strict lineage lines when one of the sub-band members, Cephu himself, committed the unforgivable crime of placing his net in front of others during the hunt. The only significant relationship of the flux to forest life is that it enables the band to respond to changes in environmental conditions by altering its size.

They are not expected to provide food in significant quantities until they are well into their teens. Learning to hunt, therefore, is largely a play activity for the boys, and they receive little formal instruction from older men until they are about 12 years old. Play hunting can begin as early as age 3. Older children make a little bow of wood and twine, with arrows of grass stems, and teach the toddler to shoot it, aiming first at still targets a few inches away and graduating to moving targets such as the ubiquitous dung beetle. Little girls participate in these games too, and frequently a play group of four to six kids pretends to cut up, cook, and serve an imaginary animal in the same way that North American children have an imaginary tea party. As the boys grow older, they graduate from shooting dung beetles and grasshoppers to shooting small birds such as waxbills. These tiny birds, related to the sparrows and finches and weighing a few grams, are plucked and may be cooked and eaten by little boys and girls. In the age range 9 to 12 other games are played, now exclusively by boys, that teach hunting skills and that may include adolescent males as well. N/ebi is a kind of javelin toss played by a number of boys: Each throws a light wand and bounces it off the ground to see who can throw it the farthest. /N!au (ÒspearÓ) is a target-practice game in which a rough wooden spear with a ball of padding at the end is hurled back and forth between two teams of boys to see whose aim is the most accurate. The main tracking skills, however, are acquired through the on-going study of nature as the young boys and girls learn to identify the hundreds of plants and animals in their environment. Studying animal tracks is a major pastime of the older boys.
Around age 12 a boy starts accompanying his father, uncles, or older brothers on hunts. Within a couple of years his father makes him his first quiver set, with unpoisoned bone and metal arrows and a scaled-down quiver and bow. The boy becomes more active in shooting, with mongeese, genets, hares, and game birds as the main targets; during the winter months the young adolescent boy also builds snarelines, often under the guidance of his father or grandfather. The assumption of adult status as a hunter comes with the first successful killing of an antelope, such as kudu or gemsbok, from the list of big game species (excluding [Page [p. 237]] [Page 238] warthog). The animal can be male or female and must be mature or nearly so and killed with a poisoned arrow. If these conditions are met, the first buck ceremony is held, an extremely important milestone in the life of a hunter. In the Dobe area of today the first buck ceremony is often delayed for years. To achieve the killing of the first antelope requires diligence and concentration on hunting. These are hard to combine with the demands of working on the Bantu cattle posts, and as a result a man may be 25 or 30 before he kills his first buck. In /Du/da, where no cattle posts are present, we found a situation that probably resembled the more traditional picture: adolescent boys 15 to 22 working hard at hunting and bringing in their first bucks by age 15 to 18.","Childhood activities (857)

[Page [p. 42]] on the season. In the long days of wilting between the October spring and the January summer, food is scarce and the women may go out every day into the failing veld, leaving their werft early in the morning and returning late in the afternoon. All that a woman gathers belongs to her alone, and of course is shared with her family. She feeds her husband, her children and often a visitor or two, at her own hearth. No formal instruction is practiced among the !Kung, with the possible exception of certain kinds of religious teaching and what might be called an occasional hunting school. Learning to gather comes from the children's observation of the more experienced women. Girls soon learn to recognize more than a hundred kinds of edible plants that grow in Nyae Nyae, as well as the seasons and places in which these plants grow. They learn to see tiny, shriveled root vines coiled around thorns in the thickets and, in the process, develop fine powers of observation. Possibly complementary to this lack of formal instruction, no formal pressure is exerted on young people to take up adult roles. Girls, if they wish, accompany their mothers on gathering trips. If they do not, they rarely feel guilty. A girl usually begins to feel responsible soon after she marries, which is often before puberty.

The uxorilocal phase of marriage, which lasts until the birth of the couple's first child, may be, therefore, as long as 10 years. It is a period of apprenticeship for both spouses; although the girl can handle household tasks by the time she is married, she continues to gather foods and to run her household under the eye of her mother. From the gossip and conversation of the women with whom she and her mother spend the day, she furthers her education in personal matters and those pertaining to the band. The husband, under the tutelage of his father-in-law, perfects his hunting and other subsistence techniques and learns from the older man and his cronies the conduct of band affairs. The husband occasionally hunts with his father-in-law when the band is gathered in one camp and during the time that the extended household is in isolation during winter and early summer. He makes a present of part of every game animal he kills but not birds and small mammals, to his parents-in-law. (Plant foods are not shared unless drought is severe and food is short.) As the relationship between the young husband and his parents-in-law is usually one of affection combined with respect, the parents are able to influence the couple's reactions when conjugal tensions arise. That such tensions seldom develop into serious threats to the safety of the marriage is due partly to parental influence and partly to the fact that the young wife and husband are seldom thrown onto their own unaided resources; only when in the doubtful privacy of their shelter, standing next to that of the parents, are they likely to be alone together. For the rest, their field of interaction includes the whole household, the two couples and the wife's young siblings.","Hunting and trapping (224)

There is no regular time for feeding: infants are given the breast whenever they cry and whenever the mother is resting. From the time that the infant is given its name, its process of socialization begins. The mother is pleased if others pay her child attention and play with him. Teaching the child to walk is a group activity, greatly enjoyed by women and older children. Bushmen children do not go through a proper crawling stage, probably because the child is always held standing on its feet when playing with it. Physically they are certainly most precocious and between their sixth or eighth months are taught to walk. This consists of passing the infant from one side to another of a circle of women and children, holding him in an upright position and, at first, gently allowing him to fall forward into the hands of the person opposite in the circle. Later, children are allowed to fall forward onto their hands, but are encouraged to stand up again. The rhythms of the dances are instilled into the children at about the same age by taking their hands and beating time with them. By the time they are able to walk, they are able to keep closely approximate time with the complex rhythms of G/wi dances. Toilet training, if one might term it thus, in the absence of facilities other than the bush itself, is also shared by the women of the band and consists of hastily positioning an empty melon-skin or [Page 78] other suitable receptacle whenever the baby relieves himself, and of then wiping clean his bottom. If the receptacle is too late, the ensuing commotion communicates to the child the need for control. The task of teaching the child to talk is another which is shared by the band. Bushmen babies go through much the same speech development as do other babies, viz. the first sounds pronounced are those produced forward in the mouth, progressing with sounds produced further and further back. The clicks show the same ontogeny, but are mastered much later than are the vowels and the other consonants. Childhood grammar is initially simply a verb/noun juxtapositioning, with the pronouns, genitive prefixes. adverbs, adjectives, correct use of gender and of descriptive prefixes and then tenses following in that order.

ab06-007,265,141,"Early in 1934 Munro wrote saying he had discovered the existence of the women's secret girdles and their importance in the regulation of marriage as well as their magical power. 1 
1 While investigating this subject Munro was obliged to exercise extreme caution, as any misfortune, from a toothache to a fatality, was attributed to infringement of the injunction to secrecy. While he was able to dispose of the former easily, the latterÑthe death of a child suffering from an incurable malady which he was treatingÑcaused him considerable anxiety, and he was only able to overcome this difficulty with great tact and patience.
Because of his success in treating serious illness, he gained the confidence of Ainu women, two of whom (Pl. XXVII) overcame their extreme diffidence in mentioning the subject and gave him much valuable information. He found out that every woman wears a belt of [Page 142] prescribed design and length under her clothing. 1 
1 The following is extracted from a letter dated April 14th, 1934, from Munro: ÔThere is a special measure for the girdle, as I am informed by two women independently. The girdle, or rather its cord, is measured between the outstretched hands, the cord (tush) being held between the end of the thumb and the forefingerÉ. Obviously the span differs in different persons. But there is another source of difference in length. I am told that women of small size measure the difference between the sum of the measured lengths thus obtained and the conventional length for a special deity by a short measure between the shoulder joint and the thumb, while those of large size measure it between the top of the sternum and the thumb. Both these are called atem (at-tem, half arm's length) though there is a difference of several inches. The length between the outstretched arms is called shine-tem or one arm's stretch. They call this now by the Japanese name, one ken, which is 6 feet, and would say that a tush is so many ken and a half. Obviously such measurements are not constant. Moreover É the kut is strictly private in each family line of matrilineal succession, so increment of difference in length is unavoidable. However, women interrogated separately are quite positive that the length of their own cord has not changed, because the measure was handed down from the sacred ancestral source. Unfortunately, I can find no note as to the age at which girls were first given their girdles, whether a small girdle was given to young girls, and whether the first assumption of the girdle was accompanied by any ceremony.Õ
This is called the upshoro (or upsoro) kut, but in ancient tradition it is referred to as a-eshimukep. A is an honorific corresponding to the Japanese O, and eshimukep means Ômost hidden thingÕ. Other names used only by old people are ishirimauriri meaning Ôsustaining great [or bodily] strengthÕ, raun kut or ram kut, under-girdle or soul or spirit girdle. At first he discovered only three types of kut, which were said to indicate three lines of matrilineal descent and were associated respectively with Wakka-ush Kamui, the deity of fresh water, Kim-un Kamui, the bear deity and Rep-un Kamui, the sea deity or grampus. Each type is woven in a particular way, with a definite number of strands and attached tabs, and is made of wild flax (hai). Every woman inherits from her mother her type of kut; men are supposed to have no knowledge of them and are never allowed to see them; even among themselves women are cautious about talking of them or exposing them. Girls are taught that they must not reveal the secret of their girdle to anyone. At the time of Munro's investigations in the early thirties many young women were no longer capable of making girdles for themselves, and older women had to do it for them when a new one was required. They knew little more than the names of the kamui to whom their girdles were dedicated. The kut were reputed to have magical powers by means of which women were said to be able to calm a storm, hold back [Page 143] a tidal wave or a conflagration and repel the kamui of small-pox. 1
1 When Munro's house was burnt down he did not know of the power that women were able to exercise by means of their kut, but he noticed that a group of women about fifty yards away stood waving their armsÑpresumably driving away the fire by means of the power they exercised on account of their kut.","Observation in research (123)

It was difficult to find out whether the fathers' or mothers' brothers took the greater part in training the boys and it seemed that a lad eager to go out hunting would be taken by any grown man, who in the very small community is usually a relative. Lads would be encouraged by their elders to shoot at a mark with their bows and arrows, and later they would stalk small birds and shoot fish 1

When a child tells a lie he may be told ÒGo away, I do not believe what you say,Ó but it appeared that even young children were usually truthful. One thing is taught the lads systematically, that is the method of collecting honey from the combs of the rock bee. Whenever the caves are conveniently situated a ladder of creepers is suspended from a tree in the jungle above and hangs over the end of the face of rock which forms the cave. On this the youths play at Òhoney getting.Ó At Pihilegodagalge the lads were quite willing to demonstrate to us how it was done, and the elder men showed clearly that this [Page 92] was a game which they encouraged. A lad of about thirteen collected some green leaves and tied them together with creeper, then taking an arrow, a toy masliya, and a broken gourd tied with creeper, which hung over his arm, for a maludema, he set fire to the leaves and climbed the ladder 1 . While lowering the smoker and letting the smoke blow into the crevice in the rock where the comb was supposed to be, he pretended to cut round its sides with an arrow and thrust at it with his masliya (figure 3), from which he transferred the honey into the gourd. As he descended from the ladder he beat his chest and sides as though driving off the bees, and directly he reached the ground rushed into the jungle to escape from them, all the smaller children imitating him with great glee. Obviously this was a well-known and favourite game, for even the elders took part in it, throwing their cloths over their heads and running into the jungle.","Weapons (411)

If we examine their weapons and implements of various kinds that is, those usually carried about--they will be found to be comparatively few in number and simple. A woman has always a pitchi --that is, a wooden trough varying in length from one to three feet, which has been hollowed out of the soft wood of the bean tree ( Erythrina vespertilio ), or it may be out of hard wood such as mulga or eucalypt. In this she carries food material, either balancing it on her head or holding it slung on to one hip by means of a strand of human hair or ordinary fur string across one shoulder. Not infrequently a small baby will be carried about in a pitchi (Fig. 7). The only other implement possessed by a woman is what is popularly called a Òyam stick,Ó which is simply a digging-stick or, to speak more correctly, a pick. The commonest form consists merely of a straight staff of wood with one or both ends bluntly pointed, and of such a size that it can easily be carried in the hand and used for digging in the ground. When at work, a woman will hold the pick in the right hand close to the lower end, and, alternately digging this into the ground with one hand, while with the other she scoops out the loosened earth, will dig down with surprising speed. In parts of the scrub, where the honey ants live, that form a very favourite food of the natives, acre after acre of hard sandy soil is seen to have been dug out, simply by the picks of the women in search of the insect, until the place has the appearance of a deserted mining field where diggers have for [Page 24] long been at work Òprospecting.Ó Very often a small pitchi will be used as a shovel or scoop, to clear the earth out with, when it gets too deep to be thrown up merely with the hand, as the woman goes on digging deeper and deeper until at last she may reach a depth of some six feet or even more. Of course the children go out with the women, and from the moment that they can toddle about they begin to imitate the actions of their mother. In the scrub a woman will be digging up lizards or honey ants, while, close by, her small child will be at work, with its diminutive pick, taking its first lessons in what, if it be a girl, will be the main employment of her life.","Collecting (222)

The Tiwi, now about a thousand in number, have lived for untold centuries on Melville and Bathurst Islands, which are situated thirty miles north of Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory. The islands and surrounding waters are well supplied with food, and fresh water is plentiful. Economically and technically the Tiwi have been remarkably conservative. They came to the islands as hunters and gatherers of wild food, using crude chipped stone axes, digging sticks, simple wooden spears, and hunting dogs, and found that little else was needed to exploit the natural resources and to provide themselves with a stable, varied, and adequate diet. With the exception of the wallaby, the land animals of the two islands were small and nocturnal and could simply be collected during the day with little physical effort or skill. The few skills that were necessary were identifying tracks to find game and chopping out or digging up the sleeping animals. Young boys and girls were taught these techniques, since there was no essential sexual division of labor in food-collecting. Boys, however, received TIWI NATIVE on Melville Island expresses a grievance in an original song during the annual three-day Kulama ceremony. [Page [p. 11,(C)]]

Until this time most of his hunting has been confined to the immediate environs of the hut. When a boy first starts to accompany his father, he makes only about one excursion per week, but as he gradually becomes hardened to the jungle, his trips away from camp become more frequent and of longer duration. On these expeditions the boy gradually learns when, where, and how to track and stalk game. His father allows him to take easy shots, so as to reinforce his interest in hunting. The boy is given light loads of game to carry in from the jungle, and if he kills an animal of any importance, such as a peccary or coati, he is decorated with feathers like a mature hunter. During all this time, of course, he is also learning to make bows and arrows and to repair those which have been broken on the hunt. Hence, by the time a boy has reached the age of 12, he is already a full-fledged hunter and is able to sup[80]ply a household of his own with game.

A child's playground is the landing place with its moored canoes.

In the manufacturing process the woman plays at best an ancillary role. The father requires his prepuberty son to witness the different phases of canoe construction over and over again. But in addition to being exposed to the technical processes involved, the child also develops the realization that boat making requires esoteric skills on the part of the master craftsman.

Since the Bororo headman, boe eimejera , should be a good hunter, a good fisherman, a good craftsman, and above all an intellectual with great knowledge of tribal traditions, myths, and songs, and since all skills and knowledge are acquired from one's fathers and initiators, the office of headman is not transmitted matrilineally but goes from father to son.

From his matrilineage, from his classificatory brothers, and from his namegiver (if he is one of his brothers) a man will inherit the right to ceremonial performances, names, and songs; but he will not be taught how to perform the ceremonies or how to sing the songs unless he pays his instructors.

If your father is a knowledgeable man, if he is a chief of the Bororo, he will want you to be like him, to be as knowledgeable as he is. He will will die but you will be here in his place, you will be the chief of the Bororo in his place. With this in mind he instructed you in all these things.

The people will say, ÒIt may be that his father was ignorant, and because of this he does not know anything.Ó I know things and thus the people do not gossip about my father. People say about me, ÒWith him is his father's knowledge and reason.Ó
Another example. The people do not quarrel with your father or with your mother, nor do they quarrel with you; they will say, ÒYes, he is the true child of his parents, he is just like they are.Ó But if you fight and quarrel with people, they will say: ÒHe is not the child of his parents; they are different.Ó
However, if your father does not know things, you will kill some animal, you will catch some fish, and you will give them to someone who knows things, and he will teach you. The people will then say, ÒThe father is no good, and yet his son speaks so well. He is not stingy with meat and fish and feathers. He is knowledgeable, because he is not stingy. So after having been an orphan, he is not an orphan anymore.Ó 1

The girls are diligently instructed by their mothers in the domestic duties of females, and early inured to labour and inaccomodation.

Alaykin, chief Cacique of the town of Concepcion, whenever he visited me, held a little boy five years of age upon his lap. This child, who was as restless as a young ape, would sometimes pull his father's nose or his hair, and sometimes struck his face. The old man, pleased at this, would cryÑÒLook, Father! can you ever doubt that this fearless boy will sometime come to be a famous soldier or captain, since he is not afraid of me, a leader so victorious and so formidable to the Spaniards?Ó The same boy would throw bones, horns, or any thing else he cold lay hold on, at his mother, when she came to call him home.

The Selk'nam can hunt only the indigenous animals and those that land on the coasts there; from the riches of the sea that surrounds their homeland, only occasionally does a stranded whale come for their benefit. To an extent scarcely worth mentioning, the woman also participates in acquiring food by gathering fish, lower sea-animals, and a few plant products. The Indian, to be sure, is faced with an undeniably limited choice among everything that is useful for subsistence; every other animal species, however, if it comes within range and offers him enough, more or less finds its way into his stomach. There are 270 no species that could be tamed for domestic animals, and there is a complete absence of the natural conditions for horticulture or agriculture. Therefore the life of the roving hunter is forced upon our Indian, if he wants to remain alive, by nature itself.","Sociocultural trends (178)

Be industrious, get up early in the morning, do not quarrel with others! That is what he said. Just look, that one there [= Nana's son] is constantly fighting with others!

When you grow up and you quarrel with other people, there will be war; many Selk'nam will have to die, others will suffer much sorrow from it. Thus, much sorrow and pain will come to you too, because you will be guilty! In this way my father constantly warned me against quarreling with others. (91) 
Here he spoke from his innermost soul! For Tenenesk was a constant faultfinder, a pugnacious, vindictive nature, a feared medicine man.
He told me how I should practice ceaselessly with the sling, with bow and arrow. All this I followed!Ó After brief, silent reflection, he continued: ÒHe spoke good words and often repeated them to me. I still know them all. That is why I act as my father said. I am therefore a good man; all the Selk'nam say that! ... That was customary in olden times, the adults always instructed the children. Today there is many a father who does not act like the Selk'nam of old. He does not instruct his children either. He lets them loaf about everywhere, but never says a good word to them. His children are lazy and indolent, work-shy and quarrelsome. Look at that one there! He is a ne'er-do-well and 406 a bad rascal; he is like his father. (92)

Go to end note pageafter that most parents pose systematic demands. When sons reach the age of five or six, fathers assume increasing responsibility for their rearing. As seamanship requires stoicism and fortitude, fathers discourage crying and other behavior they consider Òbabyish.Ó If a six-year-old boy continues to cry and whine, his father may ridicule or punish him; if the boy abandons such habits, he may be rewarded with a hunting trip or an invitation to help paint father's boat. As soon as sons can understand and follow relatively complicated directions, fathers transmit fishing and seamanship skills. By the age of eleven or twelve, most boys spend summers at sea; several years later, they assume full-fledged crew responsibilities, a goal toward which nearly every New Harbor boy aspires. The girl's carefree years are interrupted at the age of seven or eight, when mothers begin to systematically transmit housekeeping and child-care skills. Four or five years later, girls are ready to assume responsibility for running the household while mothers work at the cannery. Although some whites vigorously protest Aleut parents' alleged exploitation of their daughters, the girls appear quite willing to assume these responsibilities.

Education of this kind is an informal process in which the child more or less adopts the example set by older people. This is relatively easy for girls who begin to take their part in household chores at a very early age. Because of the nature of the subsistence activities and the special skills and physical stamina involved, a boy may be nearly out of the period of childhood before he really begins to participate actively. The necessity of attending school further restricts his involvement in adult activities. During the summers of 1960 and 1961 boys between the ages of ten and fourteen, but seldom younger, were frequently observed accompanying their fathers or older brothers on brief hunting trips away from the village. On these trips the boys did not participate in any active way in the hunt, nor were they equipped to do so. These boys did not appear to know much about the operation of a rifle and no rifles were taken along for their use. Usually they carried game bags and perhaps also helped to prepare the fire, and made themselves useful in other ways. As a special treat, they might be allowed to operate the outboard motor on the return trip. In other words, if a boy learns anything on trips of this kind, he does so entirely from observation. His duties on such trips are much the same as his duties at home.
Several sixteen year old informants claimed they had hunted caribou frequently with their fathers but admitted that they had not as yet shot a moose nor did they know much about moose hunting. Many young men in their early twenties said that they also had begun trapping at about the age of sixteen. Usually they went along with their fathers or some other relative for several years who showed them how to recognize tracks, set traps, skin animals and all other aspects of trapping. Not the least of these, and perhaps the most difficult to learn, would be becoming familiar with the country. It is generally the rule that a young man will trap with some older relative for at least four or five years before [Page 45] attempting to go out on his own. This means that by the time a man is in his early or middle twenties, he is thoroughly familiar with at least one and probably more trapping areas and is also skilled at other trapping activities. It seems likely that older men began trapping at an earlier age. One informant in his mid forties claimed that he had started trapping with his father when he was thirteen years old. He often stayed in camp as a sort of handy man, feeding dogs, making tea and performing other chores. The increasing tendency toward sedentary community life, as well as school responsibilities, has kept younger children in the village most of the time. It should be emphasized that youths even as old as nineteen or twenty frequently do not trap regularly. It may be that the family does not have enough dogs so that both the father and son can trap, or perhaps a father will prefer to have his son in the village looking after the rest of his family while he is in the bush.","Transmission of skills (868)

Young boys, in line with the division of labor between the sexes, are more likely to be taken out hunting and trapping with their fathers, at which time they are instructed in the finer details of hunting, trapping, cold-weather camping, snowmobile repair, etc. Instruction in these areas, as in most areas of cultural transmission, tends to be a nonverbal process.

In summer, with only pebbles to work with, they simply lay out the ground plans, but in winter they borrow their parents' snow-knives and make complete houses on a miniature scale. They trace too figures of men and animals in the snow, and carve them out of single blocks; for example, two small boys one day set up a snow-rabbit on top of a hill; one ran and stabbed it through the heart with his knife, while the other completed its demolition by slicing off its head. Sometimes they make toy sleds of ice, like the real ones that are used by their parents in emergencies. One of their games in which the adults sometimes join imitates the killing and cutting up of a bearded seal. A child lies flat on the ground while the others gather around him and pull him about as though they were hewing him to pieces.

The central feature of Ojibwa social organization lies in the integral relationship between the two classes of kin that are formed in Ego's generationÑsiblings and nonsiblingsÑand the reciprocal distinction made by individuals of Ego's parents' generation between the children of classifactory siblings of their own sex and the offspring of siblings of opposite sex. An Ojibwa child not only must learn terminological distinction between siblings and nonsiblings of his own generation associated with contrasting roles; correlatively he must learn that the reciprocal roles he is requested to play toward the parents of these two classes of kin require contrasting patterns of behavior as well as terminological distinction. Once a child becomes aware of these differential modes of conduct and terminology and is able to act in accordance with them, his roles in the entire social system become crystallized.
A child soon learns, for example, not only that he has many siblings but that his father and mother likewise have many kin of the same class. He discovers through experience, moreover, that all the men [Page 344] whom his father calls ÒbrotherÓ play a role toward him which resembles very closely that of his own father, and they use the same kinship terms in direct address that they apply to their own children. Reciprocally, the term that the child is taught to use for the ÒbrothersÓ of his father has a social connotation that is well conveyed by the English term Òstepfather.Ó Consequently, in his own generation Ego identifies the children of these men as siblings and uses brother and sister terms for them, as they do in addressing him.","Kinship terminology (601)

nr13-007,416,30,"Obviously what actually takes place is somewhat different from the above theory. From analyzing the case material gathered, in actuality the acquisition of power seems to work in one of three ways. A doctor's son sees his father practice and purposefully or unintentionally learns the different dances, songs, and techniques. The father instills in his son the desire to be a doctor and convinces him that he will dream. He tells him what type of dreams to expect and warns him to remember them and to follow the instructions he receives, lest he incur the anger of the spirit who is trying to befriend him and become ill. There is constant parental pressure to dream and to remember the dream, and this pressure is backed up by the community. A person with power is revered. Furthermore, a doctor, blood-letter, or special technician can expect to gain both prestige and material benefit from his power.","Status, role, and prestige (554)

In the first place, the child hears his parents and other older people discuss the gifted members of the community with respect and fear and develops a desire for power. Furthermore, his parents directly encourage him to acquire power by constantly telling him that he will dream and asking him to report the dreams so that they can help him interpret them. At times of illness and emotional stress they offer power as an explanation for the condition of the child. In these ways the parents teach the child to desire and expect a supernatural helper. 6","Theory of disease (753)

If a child strikes his parents, they hit him back. Children are told that a big owl or [Page 69] a wildcat will take them off if they do not mind. They are told that if they get angry when they eat they will swell up. Over and over again they are told that they should love their parents and their siblings and should not be angry with them nor fight with them.

nr13-007,419,74,"In summary, with respect to both men and women, aggression within the family is strictly controlled. This control is taught in childhood by direct punishment. The child is instructed not to be aggressive toward his family or other people, to love his parents, stand by his siblings and be pleasant to outsiders. He observes that his parents are afraid to express aggression and show guilt about having mean thoughts and bad dreams. The fear of having bad power and unconsciously killing his own family is instilled in him. As a result all aggression against his family is inhibited. When it breaks through these inhibitions it takes the form of sudden and violent outbursts, most often against the spouse who is not so essential as parents and siblings. If it is not expressed in this manner or displaced outside the family it results in self-punishment in the form of guilt and suicide.","Adjustment processes (154)

nr13-007,420,106,"When a girl first menstruates she is secluded in the menstrual hut for one month. 55 Some informants said each family had a menstrual hut, others that there was just one for each camp group.The girl's mother, or sometimes her grandmother, lectures her at this time about sex and menstrual taboos. It is said that some girls are very upset by these talks. The mother or grandmother puts a sagebrush bark band around the girl's head so that she will have long hair. She ties bands around the girl's ankles, knees, wrists, arms, and waist. Girls are supposed to wear badger skin aprons in the menstrual hut, use a stick to scratch themselves, brush their hair every day with a porcupine brush, and bathe, preferably in running water. They are supposed to get up early, pile wood and move around fast, make their own fires and cook for themselves. They are advised to drink warm water, eat lightly lest they become heavy eaters, and abstain from meat lest they bring bad luck to the man who killed the game, and lest they bleed a lot like animals. They may never take sweat baths or attend doctorings. Both men and women may visit, but only children may sleep in the house with them. When the month is over the girl takes a bath, puts on a new dress, paints her face with red paint and returns home. During subsequent menstrual periods she is secluded for five days and observes the same taboos.","Outbuildings (343)

11 Man, 1929, 148.. It is the mother and other women who look after a child till nearly the age of puberty; and to-day as in the past, though the father is no longer wholly occupied in hunting and therefore much more at home, the traditional pattern still holds good. I have more than once seen a man left in charge of his small children while the mother was away and treating them in the fussy sort of way that one would expect of a man not very sure of his ground Ñ sure of his authority, which was not being called in question, but not at all sure of his ability to deal with childish problems which the mother on her return can settle at once. It is the mother who gives the children immediate comfort and protection; she it is who teaches them the elementary rules of conduct and decency, who impresses upon them that they must obey father, because he is father, and who sees that as they grow older they help her with such small tasks as they can manage. It is to their mother that children run when hurt or frightened, and it is by her that they are nursed when ill. She thus has a large claim on their affection, but this would be reduced if they saw her disrespectfully treated by their father. On the whole, the claim is reinforced among the Dorobo by the way men treat their wives. And in old age a mother is taken care of by her son, and whereas she brought him up in his infancy, so now in her old age she [Page 26] helps his wife to bring up his children, continuing her claim on him in affection which outlasts childhood into old age.","Family relationships (593)

The father's brother is the equivalent, as an authority in the lives of children, of the mother's brother among the Nandi and elsewhere, and is as near as possible a second father. Patrilocal residence as well as other factors no doubt account for this; and the effect is that the father's brother is someone to be reckoned with, a man with whom a boy should keep on good terms, and one of whom permission must be obtained before a boy is circumcised. Kimutai arap Ruto is Arap Mining's brother. He lived in the same settlement at Kipukua, and saw his brother's children every day. When he greeted them, he said, Sopai, leiye, and they answered, Epa, papa. (Here leiye is used loosely as a term of familiarity.) The father's brother gives the children food and other things; he teaches them much of what it is necessary for them to know, and when they ask him questions, like what is this grass called? what are you going to do with that piece of wood? what made those marks on the ground? and so forth, he answers them in such a way that question and answer become part of their education. He shows them his bow, arrows, and quiver, his knives, his honey bags. He takes them into the forest and tells them how people look after their bees, how they make honey-barrels, and how they take honey. He teaches them to use firesticks, and explains the magical observances towards bees and honey.","Residence (591)

In a folktale of the father who spoils his eldest son, the boy is so disliked by his brothers that they plot to kill him.

These contacts are not large owing to the nature of the country and the social system, and thus the relatives with whom a child is seriously concerned are but few.

fl20-004,425,29,"But at the age of usefulness, which comes a little before the onset of puberty, and depends on the child's growth and intelligence, there is a division of duties between the parents. The father begins to teach his son the elements of hunting and trapping, how to make things of wood, how to skin animals, and how to use a bow and arrow, in short, how to behave like a man and do man's work. The mother teaches her daughter how to manage a home, how to look after small children, and how to perform the normal tasks of a Dorobo woman. At this stage both boys and girls are in one respect general servants of the family; they have to herd any stock their father may possess, and make themselves useful about the homestead.Ê[Page 30]ÊThe parts played by the grandfather or grandmother, and by the father's brother and his wife are directed largely towards instruction in behaviour and morality, though a young paternal uncle may often help in teaching boys the elements of woodcraft and hunting. And although the father and mother teach their children to distinguish between right and wrong, and how to behave to their relatives, the grandparents in particular have a good deal to do with this aspect of education.","Grandparents and grandchildren (603)
