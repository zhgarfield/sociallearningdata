# sociallearningdata
Data repository for the Hunter-Gatherer Social Learning (HGSL) data. 

These data were developed and first introduced by [Garfield et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55997-9_2). 

The HGSL data includes 164 paragraphs from 85 ethnographic documents describing social learning among hunter-gatherers taken from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF) Wordl Cultures database (https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/). These 164 paragraphs included 281 unique descriptions of social learning, referred to as "instances" of social learning. Each instance was coded for the social domain in which learning occurred (e.g., subsistence skills, cultural values and kinship), the mode of learning (e.g., horizontal, vertical), and the gender and age of the learner. See [Garfield et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55997-9_2) for additional details.
